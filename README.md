# ML poker
 
## A neural network made with this [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand)
Each record is an example of a hand consisting of five playing
     cards drawn from a standard deck of 52. Each card is described
     using two attributes (suit and rank), for a total of 10 predictive
     attributes. There is one Class attribute that describes the
     “Poker Hand”. The order of cards is important, which is why there
     are 480 possible Royal Flush hands as compared to 4 

## datadriftgenerator
This python file generates datadrift and makes new patterns depending on the overal mean and standard deviations from the dataset.

## format

1) S1 “Suit of card #1”
      Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs}

   2) C1 “Rank of card #1”
      Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King)

   3) S2 “Suit of card #2”
      Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs}

   4) C2 “Rank of card #2”
      Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King)

   5) S3 “Suit of card #3”
      Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs}

   6) C3 “Rank of card #3”
      Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King)

   7) S4 “Suit of card #4”
      Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs}

   8) C4 “Rank of card #4”
      Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King)

   9) S5 “Suit of card #5”
      Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs}

   10) C5 “Rank of card 5”
      Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King)

   11) CLASS “Poker Hand”
      Ordinal (0-9)

      0: Nothing in hand; not a recognized poker hand 
      1: One pair; one pair of equal ranks within five cards
      2: Two pairs; two pairs of equal ranks within five cards
      3: Three of a kind; three equal ranks within five cards
      4: Straight; five cards, sequentially ranked with no gaps
      5: Flush; five cards with the same suit
      6: Full house; pair + different rank three of a kind
      7: Four of a kind; four equal ranks within five cards
      8: Straight flush; straight + flush
      9: Royal flush; {Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten} + flush
      
depending on the card a binary representation is made. 
| S's| C's|Poker hand|
|----|----|----------|
|8192|32  |512       |

so if the data drift is -24 the first bit of the binary representation is a signed bit
then it pushes 1 tot the end of the array until it pushes a total of 24 and no 1's are overflowed
